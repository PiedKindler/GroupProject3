# GroupProject3
This is the repository for the group project work from SDEV220-10P-P1-202230-I-81X Spring Semester 2023 with group members Misty Mayfield, Wayne Bell, Brionna Morris, and Diego Ansaldo.

Project Description: Our Group will be developing a Python GUI program that acts as an inventory management system for an e-coating automobile parts manufacturing plant that orders parts and products for various customers. It will include the following:
1.	Product Information: The system stores information about each product, such as name, description, SKU, unit of measure, cost, and reorder level.
2.	Inventory Tracking: The system keeps track of the number of items in stock, their location, and the quantity of each product that has been sold.
3.	Purchasing: The system generates purchase orders for products that have fallen below the reorder level. It also tracks vendor information, such as contact details, payment terms, and delivery times.
4.	Sales Management: The system provides information on sales history and can generate sales reports based on specific dates or products.
5.	Barcode Scanning: The system supports barcode scanning for fast and efficient data entry, which can be especially useful for tracking the movement of products in and out of stock.
6.	User Management: The system has a user management system that allows administrators to add, delete, or modify users and their roles.
7.	Reporting: The system provides a variety of reports that can be used to analyze inventory levels, sales trends, and other data. These reports can be generated in various formats, such as PDF, Excel, or HTML.
8.	Integration: The system can be integrated with other systems such as accounting or e-commerce platforms to provide a complete solution for businesses.


Project Management & Roles: More decisive roles and responsibilities will be determined once production as the program begins. Roles will be distributed between coding different parts of the project, and managing the data responsibilities of the program such as inventory, sales, purchases, and GUI integration.
